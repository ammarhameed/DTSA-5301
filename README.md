# DTSA-5301
This repository contains my assignments work for the DTSA-5301 Data Science as a Field course, there are two directories/folders, described as follows:
  - Week-3-NYPD: Goes over the analysis I have done as part of the course for the NYPD shooting incidents data set.

Each directory contains 4 files, a .rmd file that has R code, and the other 3 documents are the knitted version of it in PDF, HTML and Word fomat.
